              <p class="paragraphs">
                My name is Gabriel Conde. I am a student from Dr. Olga Mohan Highschool. In my freetime when I'm not working
                on schoolwork I enjoy expressing myself by playing guitar. I would say guitar is an important aspect of who I am.
                Anyone who knows me, whether it be friends or family, knows that I have a dear passion for playing the guitar. My
                family origantes from Oaxaca, Mexico. I am very proud of my indegenous roots because my culture ditinguishes me from
                other people. We practice danza, music, and celebrate traditions that have been passesed on for generations. I believe
                my ancesteros live on through me and are built into my personality. I continue to represent my family and my culture
                each and every  day of my life.

              <h3 class="headers">My Goals:</h3>
             <p class="paragraphs">My future goals consist of many things I  want to achieve in life. One goal I aspire every day to achieve is to
                repay my mother financially like buying her a house or car. My mother has shaped who I have become as a person and
                I will forever be thankful for everything she has  taught me including proper mannerisms, to always do my best.
                and to alwyas  embrace who I am. Secondly, I aspire to have a proper mindset and create a balance for my life. At a
                young age I am always learning and looking for new experiences. Through TXT I have seen how much I have grown as a
                person. I have overcome doubt, the urge to give up, and mental struggles such as anxiety and stress. I know  that
                with hard work, I can grow every day and improve my leadership skills, communication skills, and speaking skills.
                I want to continue to have perserverance and determination as I go through life. On the other hand, by creating
                a balance between my career, hobbies, interests, and relationships, I can have a better control over my life. I
                want to reach my full potential in all aspects of my life. I want to form healthy attitudes and good people skills
                that can allow me to network and get ahead. Lastly, a goal I want to achieve is having learned everything I could.
                I don't mean learning everything in the world, but instead is never wasting a day and time to learn new skills and
                thoughts. 10 years from now I want to have absorbed more knowledge and fearless of change. 10 years I want to be more
                wiser, adaptable, and complete.
